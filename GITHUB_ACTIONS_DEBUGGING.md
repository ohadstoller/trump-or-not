# GitHub Actions Debugging Guide

## üîç How to View Detailed Logs in GitHub Actions

When a workflow fails with "exit code 1", you need to dig into the logs to see what went wrong.

### Step-by-Step: View Detailed Logs

1. **Go to Actions Tab**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/ohadstoller/trump-or-not/actions

2. **Click on the Failed Workflow Run**
   - You'll see a list of workflow runs with status icons:
     - ‚ùå Red X = Failed
     - ‚úÖ Green check = Success
     - üü° Yellow dot = Running
   - Click on the failed run (usually at the top)

3. **Click on the Job Name**
   - You'll see a job called **"post-tweet"** with a red X
   - Click on it to expand

4. **View Individual Steps**
   - You'll see all the steps:
     - ‚úÖ Checkout code
     - ‚úÖ Setup Node.js
     - ‚úÖ Install dependencies
     - ‚úÖ Build project
     - ‚ùì Debug environment variables (NEW!)
     - ‚ùå Post tweet (where it likely fails)
   
5. **Expand the Failed Step**
   - Click on the red X step to see full logs
   - This shows you the exact error message

6. **Look for Error Messages**
   - Search for:
     - `[ERROR]` - Application errors
     - `Error:` - JavaScript errors
     - `exit code 1` - Generic failure
     - Missing credentials messages

## üõ†Ô∏è New Debug Features

I've added a **Debug Environment Variables** step that runs BEFORE posting tweets.

### What It Shows:

```
‚úÖ NODE_ENV: production
‚úÖ DRY_RUN: false
‚úÖ OPENAI_API_KEY: ‚úÖ SET (164 chars, starts with: sk-proj-...)
‚úÖ TWITTER_API_KEY: ‚úÖ SET (25 chars, starts with: GVeYSRnF...)
‚úÖ TWITTER_API_SECRET: ‚úÖ SET (50 chars, starts with: 2TwGTgOO...)
‚úÖ TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ‚úÖ SET (50 chars, starts with: 19825465...)
‚úÖ TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET: ‚úÖ SET (45 chars, starts with: J3RBU44s...)
‚úÖ NEWS_API_KEY: ‚úÖ SET (36 chars, starts with: pub_a845...)
```

### What to Look For:

**‚ùå If you see any "NOT SET":**
- That secret is missing in GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/ohadstoller/trump-or-not/settings/secrets/actions
- Add the missing secret

**‚ùå If you see "TOO SHORT (invalid)":**
- The secret value is incorrect or incomplete
- Delete and re-add the secret with the correct value

**‚úÖ If all show "SET":**
- All credentials are configured correctly
- The error is in the application code, not secrets

## üêõ Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "OPENAI_API_KEY is required"

**Cause:** Secret not configured in GitHub

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://github.com/ohadstoller/trump-or-not/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Value: Your OpenAI key from local `.env`
5. Click "Add secret"

### Error: "Twitter authentication failed"

**Cause:** Twitter credentials are missing or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Check all 4 Twitter secrets are added:
   - `TWITTER_API_KEY`
   - `TWITTER_API_SECRET`
   - `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET`
2. Verify they match your local `.env` file
3. Make sure there are no extra spaces or line breaks

### Error: "Request failed with status code 401"

**Cause:** API key is invalid or expired

**Solution:**
- **For OpenAI:** Check your key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **For Twitter:** Regenerate tokens in Twitter Developer Portal
- **For NewsAPI:** This is expected and harmless (bot uses RSS fallback)

### Error: "OpenAI API failed: Rate limit exceeded"

**Cause:** You've hit OpenAI usage limits

**Solution:**
- Check usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Add more credits to your account
- Wait for rate limit to reset (usually 1 minute)

### Error: "npm ERR! code ENOENT"

**Cause:** Missing file or build issue

**Solution:**
- Usually fixed by our workflow (we use `npm install` now)
- If persists, check the build step succeeded

## üìä Monitoring Workflow Status

### Email Notifications

GitHub automatically emails you when workflows fail. To configure:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/notifications
2. Ensure "Actions" is enabled
3. Choose email or web notifications

### GitHub Mobile App

Install the GitHub mobile app to get push notifications for:
- ‚úÖ Successful workflow runs
- ‚ùå Failed workflow runs
- Real-time progress updates

### Manual Checks

Visit https://github.com/ohadstoller/trump-or-not/actions daily to:
- Verify scheduled runs are working
- Check success rate
- Review generated tweets

## üß™ Testing Locally vs. GitHub Actions

### Test Locally First

Before debugging GitHub Actions, always test locally:

```bash
cd /Users/ohadstoller/Development/trump-or-not

# Check environment variables
npm run debug:env

# Test with dry run
DRY_RUN=true npm start

# Test actual posting (careful!)
DRY_RUN=false npm start
```

**If local works but GitHub fails:**
- Issue is with GitHub Secrets configuration
- Use the debug step in workflow to identify missing secrets

**If local fails too:**
- Issue is with your code or API keys
- Fix locally first, then commit and push

---

## üîß Advanced Debugging

### Add More Logging

If you need more detailed logs, edit `src/index.ts` or service files to add:

```typescript
logger.info('Debug checkpoint', { someVariable });
```

Then commit, push, and run the workflow again.

### Enable Step Debugging

To add more debug steps to the workflow, edit `.github/workflows/post-tweet.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Check Node version
  run: node --version

- name: List files
  run: ls -la

- name: Show environment (safe)
  run: env | grep -E "NODE_ENV|DRY_RUN" || true
```

### Download Logs

You can download complete logs:
1. Go to the failed workflow run
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon (top right)
3. Select "Download log archive"
4. Extract and search the `.txt` file

## üìù Debug Checklist

When a workflow fails:

- [ ] Go to Actions tab
- [ ] Click on failed run
- [ ] Click on "post-tweet" job
- [ ] Check "Debug environment variables" step
  - [ ] All secrets show ‚úÖ SET?
  - [ ] Any ‚ùå NOT SET or TOO SHORT?
- [ ] Check "Post tweet" step
  - [ ] What's the exact error message?
  - [ ] Is it a credential issue?
  - [ ] Is it an API issue?
- [ ] Test locally with same settings
- [ ] Compare local .env with GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Fix the issue and re-run workflow

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix Commands

### Rebuild and Push

```bash
cd /Users/ohadstoller/Development/trump-or-not
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "fix: debugging improvements"
git push
```

### Test Debug Script

```bash
npm run debug:env
```

Should show all ‚úÖ if configured correctly.

### Manual Workflow Trigger

1. Go to https://github.com/ohadstoller/trump-or-not/actions
2. Click "Post Trump Tweet"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "main"
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Watch the logs in real-time

## üìû Getting Help

If you're still stuck:

1. **Check the workflow logs** - 90% of issues are visible there
2. **Compare with local** - Does it work locally?
3. **Verify secrets** - Are all 5 secrets added correctly?
4. **Check API status** - Are OpenAI/Twitter APIs working?
5. **Review recent changes** - Did you change code recently?

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your workflow is working correctly when you see:

```
‚úÖ Checkout code (completed)
‚úÖ Setup Node.js (completed)
‚úÖ Install dependencies (completed)
‚úÖ Build project (completed)
‚úÖ Debug environment variables (completed)
  All required environment variables are set!
‚úÖ Post tweet (completed)
  Posted tweet successfully: https://twitter.com/...
‚úÖ Commit state changes (completed)
```

And a new tweet appears on: https://twitter.com/probablynot403

**Happy debugging!** üêõüîß
